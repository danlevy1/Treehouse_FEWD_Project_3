# Online Registration Form

My third project for the Treehouse Front-End Development Techdegree (see [here](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/front-end-web-development-techdegree/))



## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS



## Description

This form, while simple, uses many of the available HTML form elements. Many of the form elements have custom CSS to spruce them up a bit. Customizing form elements is notoriously difficult, but I persevered. All form elements were designed with accessibility in mind as well.
